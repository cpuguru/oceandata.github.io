                    <dt>Earth System Modeling Techniques, Strategies, Collaboration and Coordination</dt>
                    <dd>This project will work with Centers in the Earth System Modeling space to understand the needs and constraints in fully coupling their systems for better predictions. It will work across lines in observing, ocean and atmosphere modeling, space weather, interoperability, high performance computing, Cloud solutions, use cases for autonomous systems and operational data exchanges for fully coupled Earth System models.<br>&nbsp;</dd>

                <dt><a href="https://www.nopp.org">National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP)</a></dt>
                <dd>The National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) facilitates partnerships between federal agencies, academia, and industry to advance ocean science research and education. Through this collaboration, federal agencies can leverage resources to invest in priorities that fall between agency missions or that are too large for any single agency to support.<br>&nbsp;</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://www.researchvessels.org">International Research Ship Schedules and Information Pages</a></dt>
                <dd>Some 800+ research ships from 56+ nations work individually and co-operatively for much of each year. This database describes these ships, their past, present and future sea-going programs together with relevant supporting information. Currently the most comprehensive information is available for the US research fleet but international input is actively sought.<br>&nbsp;</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://www.oceanbytes.org">Ocean Bytes</a></dt>
                <dd>The Ocean Bytes blog was created to allow those students, faculty and staff at the College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment as well as the School of Marine Science and Policy to post blogs about their research projects. It is intended as an outreach mechanism so that we can share our technologies and the lessons we've learned with others. We hope you enjoy it.<br>&nbsp;</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://www.oceandata.org/oceanicinterns/index.html">OCEANIC Interns Blog Archive</a></dt>
                <dd>The OCEANIC Interns blog is one that we set up to allow our interns to blog about the projects that they've worked on. It serves as a public log of the work they've accomplished and the lessons they've learned.</dd>
                <dt><a href="https://www.unols.org">UNOLS Information Technology Infrastructure</a></dt>
                <dd>The Ocean Information Center (OCEANIC) at the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment serves as a centralized location for the UNOLS information technology infrastructure, web server, mail servers, file repository and backend relational databases. We support UNOLS office activities to modernize their IT infrastructure and secure their data. We also continuously operate both public and secure web pages and applications in support of UNOLS activities. The location of these services at UD allows the UNOLS office to rotate to various institutions without the logistical and technological hurdles involved in moving the IT services and relational databases. <br>&nbsp; </dd>
                <dt><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060207100425/http://www.gosic.org/">GOSIC - The Global Observing Systems Information Center </a></dt>
                <dd>The Global Observing Systems Program is the focus for continuing international work to understand the terrestrial, oceanic and atmospheric components of global change. It provides global and regional data sets and analyses for research, for operational oceanographic and meteorological services; and for monitoring, detection of change, and prediction of future conditions. <br><br>GOSIC provides a direct route to the GCOS (Global Climate Observing System), GOOS (Global Ocean Observing System) and GTOS (Global Terrestrial Observing System) programs and their data. It describes the components in some detail and provides links to specific projects and their data. The completed prototype for this project has been transitioned to NOAA's NCDC and made operational.<br>&nbsp;</dd>
